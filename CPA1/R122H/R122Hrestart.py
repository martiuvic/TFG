#Setting up the Simulation Environment

#OpenMM requires several pieces of information to get started, but assigning variables
#in stages can help keep things organized (and also easy to modify for future use.)

#you will also want to set up your thermostat to run in NVT (and add a barostat to run in NPT).
# Temperature, Friction Coefficient, Timestep
# This will be added to the larger simulation
thermostat = LangevinIntegrator(300*kelvin, 1/picoseconds, 0.001*picoseconds)

# Pressure, Temperature (only used for calculation),
# Frequency (how frequently the system should update the box size)
barostat = MonteCarloBarostat(1.0*atmosphere, 300.0*kelvin, 25)

# The barostat is added directly to the system rather than the larger
# simulation.
system.addForce(barostat)

#if you need distance or angle restraints between atoms, you can add them here.
#Add distance restraints
distance_restraints = HarmonicBondForce()
# First atom index (Python starts at zero!), Second atom index, Distance,
# Force Constant
# You can use as many addBond() function calls as you like, if there are
# multiple distances to restrain.
# But be careful not to duplicate any, as they won't overwrite each other,
# just additively stack up.
# distance_restraints.addBond(index1, index2, distance*angstroms,
#     force*kilocalories_per_mole/angstroms**2)
#
# # Add the collection of distance restraints to your system.
# system.addForce(distance_restraints)
#
# # Add angle restraints
# angle_restraints = HarmonicAngleForce()
# # First, second, and third atom indices, with the second atom as the vertex of
# # the angle, the desired angle in radians, and the force constant.
# # As above, add as many angle restraints as you need, but be careful not to
# # duplicate them.
